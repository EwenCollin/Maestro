# Maestro
Mobile application based on note recognition using TarsosDSP

## Overview
This application can be used to recognize notes played by a musical instrument or someone.
This application is still under development and may bug at some points.

## Roadmap
I aim to make this app interactive and useful to beginners playing an instrument.
Here are some functionnalities or modifications I plan to do.

+ add smart metronom
+ add multiple note recognition
+ add partition reader (using a XML parser)
+ add fault recognition (in rythm and note)
