Mobile application based on note recognition using TarsosDSP and a MIDI reader library. This application has for goal to be used for improving its skills on playing an instrument.

## Overview
This application can be used to recognize notes played by a musical instrument or someone, it can convert sounds to notes and then to MIDI file, it can also extract notes from MIDI file and play them (piano only). This application is also able to tell you if you play correctly a music track according to a MIDI file.

## Roadmap
I aim to make this app interactive and useful to beginners playing an instrument.
Here are some functionnalities or modifications I plan to do.

+ add smart metronom
+ improve a lot multiple note recognition according to this tutorial https://zestedesavoir.com/tutoriels/3013/reconnaissance-de-notes-de-musique/
